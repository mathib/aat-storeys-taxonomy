<h2>Abstract</h2>
<span class="markdown">
The AAT-STOREYS taxonomy contains OWL classes to classify **building storeys** via subclasses of [bot:Storey](https://w3id.org/bot#Storey).
The taxonomy concepts are extracted and restructured from the Getty Art & Architecture Thesaurus ([Getty AAT](https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/about.html)), v2020-07-29.
Other taxonomies might define classification concepts for building sites, buildings, and spaces.
The taxonomy is structured using RDFS subsumption axioms.
